## Pacman paccache hook

Using pacman hooks it is possible to execute an operation after certain pacman
tasks. Because people often forget to clear pacman's package cache this is the
prime target for setting up a hook for it. Using this hook pacman will make sure
it only keeps two old version `-rk2` and removes all versions of uninstalled
packages `-ruk0` whenever a package is installed, updated or removed.

First install the `pacman-contrib` package:

```
# pacman -S  pacman-contrib
```

Then setup the hook:

```
/etc/pacman.d/hooks/paccache.hook

[Trigger]
Operation = Install
Operation = Upgrade
Operation = Remove
Type = Package
Target = *

[Action]
Description = Cleaning package cacheâ€¦
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/sh -c "paccache -rk2 && paccache -ruk0"
```
